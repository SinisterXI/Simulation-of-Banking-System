# Simulation-of-Banking-System
The simulated banking system is designed to provide efficient and secure operations for managing customer accounts, transactions, and account verification. The implementation utilizes various data structures and algorithms to achieve these goals. The primary components include an Account Management System using Linked List and Hash Table, Transaction History using a Queue, and Account Verification using a Binary Search Tree. This report outlines the design choices, data structures, algorithms, and testing procedures employed in the project.
